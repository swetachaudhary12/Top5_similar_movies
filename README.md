## Movie Recommender System

### Overview
The Movie Recommender System is a data-driven project that suggests movie recommendations based on user-selected movies. 
It utilizes machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to calculate movie similarity and provide 
personalized movie suggestions to users.

### Features
- User-Friendly Interface: The system is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit,
  allowing users to easily select a movie from a dropdown menu.
- Movie Similarity Calculation: The system employs cosine similarity to determine the similarity between movies based on their tags,
  enabling accurate and relevant recommendations.
- Top Recommendations: Once a movie is selected, the system displays the top five movie recommendations along with their
-  posters fetched from an external API.


### Dataset and Model
The project uses a preprocessed movie dataset containing movie titles, tags, and other relevant information. The model is trained using cosine similarity to compute movie recommendations.
